# Airdrop and signatures

An airdrop occurs when a token development team distributes tokens or allows people to claim them. These tokens can be of various types, including ERC-20, ERC-1155 (multi-token contracts), or ERC-721 (NFTs).

Tokens are usually given for free, with eligibility criteria such as contributing to the project's GitHub repository or participating in the community. This process helps to _bootstrap the project_ by distributing tokens to a **list of eligible addresses**.
