# CCIP Bootcamp - Cross-Chain NFTs

A cross-chain NFT is a smart contract that can exist on any blockchain, abstracting away the need for users to understand which blockchain theyâ€™re using.

## How Do Cross-Chain NFTs Work?

At a high level, an NFT is a digital token on a blockchain with a unique identifier different from any other token on the chain.

Any NFT is implemented by a smart contract that is intrinsically connected to a single blockchain. The smart contract is arguably the most important part of this equation because it controls the NFT implementation: How many are minted, when, what conditions need to be met to distribute them, and more. This means that any cross-chain NFT implementation requires at least two smart contracts on two blockchains and interconnection between them.

## Cross-chain NFTs can be implemented in three ways

1. `Burn-and-mint`: An NFT owner puts their NFT into a smart contract on the source chain and burns it, in effect removing it from that blockchain. Once this is done, an equivalent NFT is created on the destination blockchain from its corresponding smart contract. This process can occur in both directions.

2. `Lock-and-mint`: An NFT owner locks their NFT into a smart contract on the source chain, and an equivalent NFT is created on the destination blockchain. When the owner wants to move their NFT back, they burn the NFT and it unlocks the NFT on the original blockchain.

3. `Lock and unlock`: The same NFT collection is minted on multiple blockchains. An NFT owner can lock their NFT on a source blockchain to unlock the equivalent NFT on a destination blockchain. This means only a single NFT can actively be used at any point in time, even if there are multiple instances of that NFT across blockchains.

## Implementing Burn-and-Mint model

To implement Burn-and-Mint model using Chainlink CCIP, we will on cross-chain transfer function burn an NFT on the source blockchain (Arbitrum Sepolia) and send the cross-chain message using Chainlink CCIP. We will need to encode to and from addresses, NFT's tokenId and tokenURI so we can mint exactly the same NFT on the destination blockchain once it receives a cross-chain message.

## Testing Cross-Chain contracts using Chainlink Local

* `https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local`

###  Write a unit test for our XNFT.sol smart contract

When you compile Solidity code, the two primary outputs are `Application Binary Interface (ABI)` and `EVM bytecode`.

`EVM bytecode` is the machine-level code that the Ethereum Virtual Machine executes. It is what gets deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. It's a low-level, hexadecimal-encoded instruction set that the EVM interprets and runs. The bytecode represents the actual logic of the smart contract in an executable form.

`ABI` is essentially a `JSON-formatted` text file that describes the functions and variables in your smart contract. When you want to interact with a deployed contract (e.g., calling a function from a web application), the `ABI` is used to encode the function call into a format that the EVM can understand. It serves as an interface between your high-level application (like a JavaScript front-end) and the low-level bytecode running on Ethereum. The ABI includes details about each function's name, return type, visibility (public, private, etc.), and the types of its parameters.

Anytime your message is not delivered due to error on the receiver side, `CCIP Explorer` will display the error message. However, if `ABI` is unknown to explorer (for example you haven't verified smart contract's source code on Block explorer) it will display its original content instead of human readable error message.

Couple of tools that we can use:

* `https://bia.is/tools/abi-decoder/`
* Foundry's `cast abi-decode`
* `https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/blob/ccip-develop/core/scripts/ccip/ccip-revert-reason/main.go`

## Notes

* If you are transferring only tokens, gasLimit should be set to 0 because there is no `ccipReceive` function.
* The `extraArgs` should mutable if you want to make your dApp compatible with future CCIP upgrades (https://docs.chain.link/ccip/best-practices#using-extraargs).
