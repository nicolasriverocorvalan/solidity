# SECP256k1 on Ethereum

`Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)`: Its primary functions are crucial for digital security and identity:

* **Generating Key Pairs:** ECDSA is used to create pairs of cryptographic keys â€“ a public key and a private key.

* **Creating Digital Signatures:** It allows for the generation of unique digital signatures for messages or data.

* **Verifying Digital Signatures:** It provides a mechanism to confirm the authenticity and integrity of a signed message.

The specific curve used in `ECDSA` in Ethereum is called the `secp256k1` curve. This curve is particularly significant in the context of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies because it underpins the security of digital signatures. One notable characteristic of the `secp256k1` curve is that for every `x-coordinate` on the curve, there are two valid signatures. This means that if a malicious actor knows one signature, they can compute the second one. This vulnerability is known as `signature malleability`, which can potentially lead to replay attacks where a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed.

There are several constants associated with the `SECP 256k1` curve that are crucial for its operation. One of these is the `Generator Point (G)`, which is a predefined point on the curve used in the generation of public keys. Another important constant is `n`, a prime number that defines the length of the private key. These constants are fundamental to the cryptographic processes that ensure the security and integrity of transactions on the Ethereum network.

* **Generator Point (G)**: A predefined point on the curve.
* **n**: A prime number defining the length of the private key.

The public key is an elliptic curve point calculated by multiplying the private key with the generator point `G`. This operation ensures that the public key is derived in a secure manner, making it computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the private key from the public key. This relationship between the private key, the generator point, and the public key is central to the security of ECDSA and, by extension, the security of Ethereum transactions.

## `r`, `s`, and `v`:

ECDSA signatures consist of three integers: `r`, `s`, and `v`.

1. The message is hashed
2. A random number `k` (the `nonce`) is generated.
3. Calculating signature components:
   * `r`: `x` point on the `secp256k1` curve, resulting from multiplying the nonce `k` by the generator point `G`.
   * `s`: proof the signer knows the private key, calculated using the nonce `k`, the hash of the message, the private key, and the `r` value.
   * `v`: indicates the `polarity` (positive or negative `y-axis`) of the point on the elliptic curve.

## Compute keys

* `privKey`: random integer within the range `0 to n-1`, where `n` is the order (a large prime number that defines the length of the private key).

* `pubKey = privKey.G` , where `.` denotes modular multiplication. `pubKey` is an elliptic curve point.

* `elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem`: if we times 2 big integers together, the output being a giant integer, using just the output we cannot feasibly calculate the inputs. Impossible to calculate `p` from `pubKey = p.G`. Since point arithmetic in a finite field does not support division, a computer would instead have to use brute force to determine `p` (even `G` is known).

## Compute signature

Signatures are created by combining a hash of a `message` with the `privKey`.

1. Using ECDSA algorithm, hash the message using `SHA256`.
2. Generate a secure random number K, the `nonce`.
3. Calculate a randon number `R = k.G` , which is the `nonce` times the `generator point`. 
4. `R = (x,y)`. The result of the multiplication`R = k.G` is a point on the elliptic curve, represented as `R = (x, y)`. 
5. Compute `r`.  `r = x mod n`. The value `r` is derived from the `x-coordinate` of the point `R`. Specifically, `r` is calculated as `r = x mod n`, where `n` is a prime number that defines the length of the `privKey`. This modular operation ensures that `r` is within the appropriate range for the cryptographic operations that follow.
6. Compute `s` using the `nonce` (`k`), the `hash of the message` (`z`), the `privKey` (`d`), `r`, and the order `n`.

`[ s = k^{-1} . (z + r . d) \mod n ]`

7. Compute `v`. The `recovery_id` is an integer that helps in recovering the public key from the ECDSA signature. It can be either `0 or 1`, indicating which of the two possible `y-coordinates` was used in the signature.

The addition of `27` is a convention that was adopted to distinguish Ethereum signatures from other ECDSA signatures.

## ECDSA signature verification

1. Input components:
    - message: the original message that was signed.
    - signature: the ECDSA signature, consisting of two components `r` and `s`.
    - pubKey: the pubKey (`Q`) corresponding to the private key used to create the signature.
2. Hash the message:
    - compute the hash (`z`) of the message using SHA-256.
3. Verification step:
   1. Ensure that `r` and `s` are integers in `range [1, n-1]`, where `n` is the order of the elliptic curve.
   2. Compute `w: [ w = s^{-1} \mod n ]`. Calculate the modular inverse of `s` modulo `n`.
   3. Compute `u1` and `u2` using the hash `z`, the signature component `r`, and `w`. `w: [ u1 = z . w \mod n ] [ u2 = r . w \mod n ]`
   4. Compute `[ R = u1 . G + u2 . Q ]`, the elliptic curve point `R` using the curve's generator point `G` and the public key `Q`.
   5. Ensure that `R` is not the point at infinity.
   6. Convert the `x-coordinate` of `R` to an `integer xR`.
   7. Verify that `r` is congruent to `xR modulo n`: `[ r \equiv xR \mod n ]`

***Important***: The `s` value in an ECDSA signature must be restricted to ensure security and prevent certain types of attacks, such as `signature malleability`. `s` should be restricted to the lower half of the curve's `order n`. This is known as `canonical` or `normalized` signatures.

***Using `ecrecover` directly can lead to signature malleability.***
