# Understanding Account Abstraction Transactions in zkSync

zkSync introduces a refined approach to transaction processing, particularly with its native support for account abstraction. A transaction under this model typically undergoes a two-phase lifecycle: Validation and Execution.

* `Phase 1: Validation`: This initial phase is crucial for verifying the transaction's legitimacy before it consumes significant resources or impacts the state.
* `Phase 2: Execution`: Once validated, the transaction proceeds to the execution phase, where its intended operations are carried out.

The `validateTransaction` function handles the first phase, ensuring prerequisites are met, while `executeTransaction` manages the actual state changes in the second phase.

## Deep Dive: The Transaction Validation Process

The validation phase (Phase 1) in zkSync's account abstraction model involves several key steps to ensure a transaction's integrity before it's processed further. Let's break down the initial interactions:

1. `Transaction Submission`: The user initiates the process by sending their transaction to what can be described as a `zkSync API client`. This client acts somewhat like a light node, serving as the entry point for transactions into the zkSync network.

```solidity
/**
 * Phase 1 Validation
 * 1. The user sends the transaction to the "zkSync API client" (sort of a "light node")
 * ...
 */
```

2. `Nonce Uniqueness Verification`: A critical step in preventing replay attacks and ensuring orderly transaction processing is verifying the uniqueness of the transaction's nonce. The `zkSync API client` achieves this by querying a specialized `system contract` known as the `NonceHolder`. This interaction with the `NonceHolder system contract` is a distinctive feature of zkSync.

```solidity
/**
 * Phase 1 Validation
 * ...
 * 2. The zkSync API client checks to see the nonce is unique by querying the
 *    NonceHolder system contract
 * ...
 */
```

## The Role of System Contracts in zkSync

One of the most significant architectural distinctions between Ethereum and zkSync lies in zkSync's extensive utilization of `System Contracts`. These are pre-deployed smart contracts on the zkSync network that manage fundamental protocol-level functionalities. Unlike Ethereum, where many core operations are handled by the client software or hard-coded into the protocol, zkSync delegates these to on-chain smart contracts.

The `NonceHolder.sol` contract is a prime example. Its responsibility is to manage nonces for all accounts on zkSync, ensuring that each transaction from a specific sender has a unique nonce. This mechanism is vital for maintaining transaction order and preventing double-spending.

A partial view of the `NonceHolder.sol` contract reveals its purpose:

```solidity
// lib/foundry-era-contracts/src/system-contracts/contracts/NonceHolder.sol (partial view)
/**
 * @author Matter Labs
 * @custom:security-contact security@matterlabs.dev
 * @notice A contract used for managing nonces for accounts. Together with bootloader,
 * this contract ensures that the pair (sender, nonce) is always unique, ensuring
 * unique transaction hashes.
 * @dev The account allows for both ascending growth in nonces and mapping nonces to specific
 * stored values in them.
 * The users can either marked a range of nonces by increasing the `minNonce`. This way all th
 * less than `minNonce` will become used. The other way to mark a certain 256-bit key as nonce
 * some value under it in this contract.
 * @dev Apart from transaction nonces, this contract also stores the deployment nonce for acco
 * will be used for address derivation using CREATE. For the economy of space, this nonce is s
 * packed with the `minNonce`.
 * @dev The behavior of some of the methods depends on the nonce ordering of the account. Nonc
 * here serve more as a help to users to prevent from doing mistakes, rather than any invarian
 */
contract NonceHolder is INonceHolder, ISystemContract {
    uint256 private constant DEPLOY_NONCE_MULTIPLIER = 2 ** 128;
    // ...
    mapping(uint256 account => uint256 packedMinAndDeploymentNonce) internal rawNonces;
    // ...
}
```

Other system contracts on zkSync handle tasks like managing account code storage (`AccountCodeStorage`), system-wide context (`SystemContext`), and, crucially, contract deployment. Understanding these system contracts is essential for developers building applications that deeply integrate with zkSync's capabilities. You can find a comprehensive list and descriptions of these contracts in the official zkSync Era documentation under `System Contracts`.

## Contract Deployment: A Tale of Two Networks (Ethereum vs. zkSync)

The process of deploying smart contracts differs notably between Ethereum and zkSync, primarily due to zkSync's reliance on system contracts for core operations.

### Ethereum's Deployment Mechanism
On Ethereum, deploying a smart contract involves sending a transaction where the to field (recipient address) is left null or set to the zero address. The transaction's data payload contains the compiled bytecode of the contract. Ethereum nodes recognize this specific transaction format as a contract creation request and execute the deployment. This method is well-documented in Ethereum's developer resources.

### zkSync's Deployment Mechanism:
zkSync takes a different path. Instead of the null-recipient pattern, contract deployment is facilitated by interacting with a dedicated system contract: the `ContractDeployer`. This contract resides at a well-known, predefined address on the zkSync network (for instance, `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000008006` on zkSync Era Mainnet, verifiable via the zkSync block explorer).

To deploy a contract on zkSync, you call specific functions on this `ContractDeployer` system contract. These functions include:
   * create
   * create2
   * createAccount (streamlined AA wallet deployment)
   * create2Account
   * forceDeployOnAddress

And others, each serving slightly different deployment scenarios or offering varied control over the deployment process. For example, `createAccount` is specifically designed for deploying account abstraction-compatible smart contract accounts. Developers can inspect the `ContractDeployer.sol` source code and its available functions directly on the zkSync block explorer by navigating to its address and viewing the `Write Contract` tab.

This system contract-based approach centralizes and standardizes contract deployment logic within the zkSync protocol.

## Navigating zkSync Deployment with Developer Tools: The Foundry Case

Foundry, a popular smart contract development toolkit, provides a good example. The standard Foundry command for deploying a contract, `forge create`, is tailored for the Ethereum deployment model (sending bytecode to a null address). When targeting zkSync, this command, in its vanilla form, won't work as expected because zkSync requires interaction with the `ContractDeployer` system contract.

To accommodate zkSync's deployment flow, `foundry-zksync` (the zkSync-compatible version of Foundry) introduces specific flags. For instance, you might use a command like:

```bash
# Terminal command
forge create --zksync --legacy
```

The `--zksync` flag tells Foundry to prepare the transaction for the zkSync network. The `--legacy` flag, in this context, instructs foundry-zksync to use an older deployment method that specifically interacts with the `ContractDeployer` system contract's create function. This ensures that the deployment adheres to zkSync's native process rather than attempting an Ethereum-style deployment.

Without such flags or zkSync-aware configurations, developers might find that their usual deployment commands fail or behave unexpectedly on zkSync. This highlights the importance of understanding how system contracts influence tooling interactions.
